# Frontend Delight theme for Firefox

Simple dark theme for Firefox inspired by the Frontend Delight color scheme for Sublime Text made by Bernat Fortet.  
Original: <https://github.com/bernatfortet/sublime-frontend-delight>

This repository contains two files:

- **manifest.json:**  
a normal Firefox theme (also available via the Firefox Addons store)

- **userChrome.css:**  
a better version made using custom stylesheets (visible in the screenshot below)

I never tried to use both at the same time. It might not work.
